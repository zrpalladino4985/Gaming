### Goals

-   Complete the google machine learning crash course

### Boundaries / Scope

-   Complete the prerequisites for the crash course
-   Complete the crash course the google provide for machine learning

### Success criteria

-   My own machine learning AI
-   Weekly work log with screenshots and summaries to demonstrate activity.

### Constraints

-   I have no prior knoledge in machine learning, so I will have to look over the prerequisites and learn them.

### Assumptions

-   I have all required software.

### Stakeholders

-   Professor - for grade
-   Parents - they have supported me all the way through my life until now, I want to make their invested time worth it.
-   Perspective Employers - this knowledge will help me with getting a job in the future
